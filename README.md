# NearByOpen - Covid19

Check out the product on - https://nearbyopen.com

In this stressful time, waiting at a grocery store for your essential needs is not what a person looks for. Neither do store owners want a large number of people gathering at their store. To solve this issue we came up with this idea yesterday and thought that it could help both customer and store owners to practice social distancing and still buy/sell essential items.

Store Owners
------------

[NearByOpen](https://nearbystore.com) allows a store owner to maintain social distancing at their shop by updating the number of people at the store at a particular time.

Customers
---------
[NearByOpen](https://nearbystore.com) for COVID-19 helps a customer to see the nearby stores, how many people are allowed at the store and the number of people currently at the store.

How it helps?

We encourage you to contribute to this project. We are looking to build it bigger feature by feature and have a long list of things planned.
